# jQuery Salary Calculator


## Description

*Duration: Weekend Project*

Input fields at the top record employee information including fist name, last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary. When submitted, the information will display in a table below. The application calculates annual and monthly costs based on the sum of employee salaries. If monthly costs are above $20,000 it will flag the user by turning red. Employees can be deleted from the rows using the delete button, and the costs will adjust.
